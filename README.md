# Block09 Making a personal website

The website has four pages Home, About, Portfolio and Contact.

JS has been used to put out a hidden message in console and also to do some styling for navbar.

JS has also the successful form submission alert for user

All content are actual expcept Portfolio page as I didn't have enough time to add actual info about my projects. However they are all linked to my github repo. 



Thank you for reading me!
